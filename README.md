# movie_google_trends
My first project on github. [Work in progress]
Link to tableau dashboard created with scrapped data: https://public.tableau.com/profile/piotr3000#!/vizhome/imDB/Dashboard1

## Project overview
### Purpose: 
I want to check if there is increased activity in googling particular keywords or historical events/characters after movie premiere.  
Steps:
1. Scrap info about movies from imdb
>Files:    
movies_scrap.ipynb  
imdb_movies.csv

2. Preprocess movie plot using NLP techniques
>Files:

3. Use google trends to check which keywords from plot where googled around the release date
