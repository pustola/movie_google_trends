# movie_google_trends
My first project on github.

## Project overview
### Purpose: 
I want to check if there is increased activity in googling particular keywords or historical events/characters after movie premiere.  
Steps:
1. Scrap info about movies from imdb
>Files:    
movies_scrap.ipynb  
imdb_movies.csv

2. Preprocess movie plot using NLP techniques
>Files:  
movies_nlp.ipynb [WIP]

3. Use google trends to check which keywords from plot where googled around the release date
>Files:  
movies_trends.ipynb [WIP]
