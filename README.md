# movie_google_trends
My first project on github.

## Project overview
### Purpose: 
I want to check if there is increased activity in googling particular keywords or historical events/characters after movie premiere.  
Steps:
1. Scrap info about movies from web [imdb top 250]
>Files:  
Movies.py  
Movies.ipynb  
movies.csv  
movies2004.csv

2. Preprocess movie plot using NLP techniques
>Files:  
movies_nlp.ipynb [WIP]

3. Use google trends to check which keywords from plot where googled around the release date
>Files:  
movies_trends.ipynb [WIP]
